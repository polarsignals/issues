# Polar Signals Issues

This repository is not about code!  
Instead we want to listen to your feedback about our product!

How can we make it better?  
Did you encounter anything that's not intuitive?

Please [open an Issue](https://github.com/polarsignals/issues/issues/new)!  
Even if you're not 100% sure if it's worth opening one, we will happily start the conversation with you!
